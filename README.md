# QuoteMachine

Assignment done for Free Code Camp. Tasked to create a random quote generator that allows users to tweet the quote and generate new random quotes. Used to develop my react skills. Also implemented random quote generator API that returns a JSON object containing a quote from a Women Sci-Fi Author. Also scraped the quotes from goodreads.com using node web scraper.
